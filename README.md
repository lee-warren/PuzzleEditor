Just starting off with this project so it is definetely not finished...

The aim, eventually, is to have a fully featured level creation tool for a game concept that I have:
  The game will be a grid based tile placing game, in which the aim is to direct coloured lazors from specific spots on the edges of the board to other specific spots on other edges.
  The player would achieve this by placing allocated tiles onto the grid board. These tiles might reflect the lazor beams off in to another direction, change the colour of the lazor beam as it passes through, or refract the lazor beam into two different light sources
  
 This project though is just to be able to create the levels themselves and export them into different stages and worlds.
 Another project will be made to hold the game and will read in the levels and worlds created here.
